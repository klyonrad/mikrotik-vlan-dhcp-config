This is just a dump of a Mikrotik Router configuration for a project of mine.

The goal was to VLAN trunking on one Port that is connected to an Access Point with VLAN to SSID Mapping.
While on the same time not touching the rest of the network that is driven by a typical VDSL Gateway router.

Therefore the Mikrotik router separates the net, sets rules between the and provides a DHCP Server for two networks.
Do not expect to simply use this, I am glad that it works in the way I wanted at the moment, but feel free to write Comments and feedback.
